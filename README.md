The present repository is dedicated to optimizing the Artillery Sidewinder X1 3D printer. If you're in search of enhancements to apply to your Sidewinder X1, you've landed on the right page. Within this repository, I'll be sharing my recommended upgrades for the Sidewinder X1. This information should streamline your decision-making process when considering modifications for your Sidewinder X1.

While many acknowledge the Sidewinder X1 as a proficient machine in its original setup, there will always be enthusiasts seeking to maximize their printer's performance.

I partially concur that the X1 operates effectively in its standard configuration. My Artillery Genius (the X1‚Äôs counterpart) currently operates with its default settings and produces impressive prints. However, I opted to enhance the X1 to address minor issues I encountered and to compile guides and tutorials.

## üì∑ Obico for OctoPrint

Obico is an OctoPrint plugin designed to enhance 3D printing workflows. It provides improved visualizations, analytics, and additional features to optimize your printing experience, making it a valuable tool for managing your 3D printer and prints within the OctoPrint ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compatibility and Usage with OctoPrint

The serial bus with the main board (MKS GEN L v1.0) is shared between TFT and Octoprint / Pronterface etc‚Ä¶ This means that printing from Octoprint / Pronterface etc‚Ä¶ causes Marlin to receive gcodes from Octoprint and TFT at the same time (there are collisions). This will let Marlin reply with error messages, that will be displayed on both Octoprint and TFT display, such as:

```
Line Number is Not Last Line Number +1 Last Line 1686.
```

In order to avoid the problem, when printing with Octoprint/Pronterface etc‚Ä¶ put the TFT in ‚ÄúListening Mode‚Äù pressing on the button:
``` 
Menu =>Settings=>Connection=>ON
```

### üìå Note:

- This limitation is not due to bugs on the TFT firmware but itis  an hardware limitation on MKS GEN L v1.0 main board
- The mode state is stored on FLASH allowing to restore the mode at startup. This allows to power on/off the printer remotely and to control the printer via USB without the need of any touch (from the user) on the display to engage the mode
